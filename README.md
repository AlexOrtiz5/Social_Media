# Project objective
  Embarking on an exploration of the dynamic world of social media influence, this project aims to dissect and understand the key characteristics and performance metrics of leading social media channels. Leveraging datasets that provide insights into top influencers across various platforms, such as the one available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/top-1000-social-media-channels), the objective is to identify patterns, correlations, and potential drivers of success in the digital landscape. By cleaning, processing, and analyzing data encompassing metrics like subscriber counts, engagement rates, and content categories, this project seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the top echelon of social media, ultimately revealing valuable insights into audience engagement, platform-specific trends, and the anatomy of online influence.

# Methods
  List with methods:
  - Filtering:
    - Selecting influencers based on a minimum number of subscribers.
    - Isolating data for specific audience countries.
    - Focusing on particular content categories.
    - Examining influencers within a specific range of engagement rates.
  - Grouping:
    - Calculating average engagement rates by content category.
    - Determining the median subscriber count for influencers in different countries.
    - Summarizing key statistics (mean, median, max, min) for engagement metrics per platform.
    - Grouping by influencer name to identify potential duplicates across different datasets (though you've already addressed this).
  - Sorting:
    - Ranking influencers by subscriber count (overall and per platform).
    - Listing top-performing content categories based on average engagement.
    - Identifying countries with the highest average engagement rates.
  - Aggregation:
    - Calculating total subscriber counts for each platform.
    - Finding the average engagement rate across all influencers.
    - Determining the number of unique influencers in each dataset.
  - Visualization:
    - Histograms to show the distribution of subscriber counts or engagement rates.
    - Bar charts to compare average engagement across categories or platforms.
    - Scatter plots to explore the relationship between subscribers and engagement.
    - Pie charts to illustrate the proportion of influencers from different audience countries.
    - Box plots to visualize the spread and central tendency of numerical metrics across different groups.
  - Calculating New Metrics:
    - Engagement Ratio: (Total Engagements / Number of Followers) * 100
    - Normalized Engagement: Scaling engagement metrics to a common range for comparison.
    - Subscriber Growth Rate (if temporal data is available within a merged file).
  - Basic Statistical Analysis:
    - Calculating correlations between different numerical variables (e.g., subscribers and views).
    - Performing t-tests or ANOVA to compare the means of engagement metrics across different groups (e.g., categories).

# Project Description
  The foundation of this project lies in a rich collection of datasets focused on prominent social media channels and influencers. The primary source for this analysis includes publicly available data, such as the "Top 1000 Social Media Channels" dataset from Kaggle, which aggregates information on leading profiles across various platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. These datasets offer a multifaceted view of the social media landscape, characterized by a diverse array of features. Key characteristics include quantitative metrics such as subscriber counts, average views, likes, comments, and shares, providing insights into audience size and engagement levels. Furthermore, qualitative attributes like content categories and audience demographics (e.g., country) offer context into the type of content being produced and the geographical distribution of the audience. The datasets vary in their specific columns and level of detail, reflecting the unique data points tracked by different platforms and data aggregators. By integrating and analyzing these diverse yet related datasets, this project aims to construct a holistic understanding of what defines success and influence in the contemporary social media ecosystem.
